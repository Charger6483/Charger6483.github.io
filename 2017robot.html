						<h2>Our 2017 Robot</h2> 
						<p>Rookie Year </p>
					</header>
						<p>In our rookie year, 2017, we went through a lot of mishaps, however, we also learned a lot. We learned how to fundraise, we sold muffins, hamburgers, and we even organized videogame tournaments. A lot of time and dedication went into the 2017 FRC competition. We worked together as a team in order to understand the new panorama of building a robot and actually controlling it from parts that came inside of a box. We learned how to work together as a team as well as to how to collaborate along with other people in our community.</p>
						<p>	We faced a lot of challenges when it came to building this robot. The first trial we faced was at the very beginning when we were building our robot’s chassis. The chassis that came inside the FRC 2017 robot kit came crooked and this meant that only 4 out of the 6 wheels were giving traction at any given time. We overcame this feat by redesigning a new chassis and using it instead.</p>

						<p>We also designed a cannon for this competition. The cannon was designed to throw green balls on what resembles a hoop. The cannon we designed was able to throw balls consistently in the same direction, at the same speed, and most importantly, at the same time. However, we got into a lot of issues when we were designing the cage for the ball reservoir from which the cannon would grab its munition. We went through a lot of designs until we eventually ended up with a simple, belt system design. </p>

							<h3>End Result</h3>
							<p>When it came down to the competition our robot faired extremely well considering all of its factors. We were able to make strong alliances and strategize upon which was the overall best way to succeed taking every single aspect into consideration. Our robot’s strongest attribute was its ability to deliver gears consistently and swiftly considering that it outmaneuvered most robots it went against.</p>
